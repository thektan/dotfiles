# I made a dotfiles directory!

It's a work in progress.

# Setup

No cool script yet to get it all setup so we'll need to do the following.

1. Create a symlink of .zshrc in the home directory.

```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

2. Point iTerm2 perferences file to `$HOME/.dotfiles/iterm/`
